# 🧠 Face Detection with Age & Gender Estimation (Buffalo Model)

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using the [Buffalo](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface) pretrained model from InsightFace. The model not only detects faces but also estimates age and gender with high accuracy.

## 🔍 Features

- 🧑‍🦱 Accurate Face Detection
- 🧓 Age Estimation
- 🚻 Gender Classification (Male/Female)
- 🖼️ Supports images and video streams (webcam or files)
